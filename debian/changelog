  * Really depending on gdm3 in task-lxde-desktop (Closes: #680519).

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * xfce: Use network-manager-gnome.
    Rationale: Everyone I've polled who has installed xfce for nontechnical
    users has had to switch out wicd due to its non-user-friendliness,
    which includes not managing wireless interfaces at all by default,
    and presenting the user with a screen full of dozens of configuration
    settings when a network requires a password.
    Technical users who want wicd will have no difficulty installing it.

  * Task packages are back! For now, the task-* metapackages are only
    used to hold Depends, Recommends, and Description; all other task
    info that tasksel uses remains in debian-tasks.desc. Plan is to
    migrate the rest into the task packages later, where possible.
  * FTP-master: I've put the task packages in a new section, "tasks",
    which I hope you'll approve & create.
  * Translators: DDTP translations of task packages are now displayed
    by tasksel, so it's important that the (visible) tasks' descriptions
    be translated there.
  * Don't generate Task field overrides for tasks that have only Key
    packages. In other words, the Task field overrides are not needed,
    and are going away. The overrides file uploaded with this version
    of tasksel is empty.
  * Tasksel no longer looks for desc files in /usr/share/tasksel/,
    instead it looks in /usr/share/tasksel/descs/. This was necessary
    because aptitude crashes on the new debian-tasks.desc file without
    Description fields.
  * Remove rarian-compat from task-gnome-desktop. Dependencies on
    scrollkeeper should default to rarian-compat by now.
  * Moved iceweasel to Recommends of task-desktop; was in Key/Depends.
  * Moved acpid to Recommends of task-laptop from Depends, anticipating

    with im-switch. (This can be reverted once version 1.3.3 is available).
    Closes: #404567
  * Remove ttf-arphic-bkai00mp from chinese-t-desktop, apparently it prevents
    using the uming as the default display font. Closes: #404567

  * Make a few packages key for the laptop task. This allows tasksel to
    display the laptop task as installed, which it cannot do for tasks without
    any key packages. Closes: #418816
  * Add gaim-libnotify to gnome-desktop. Needs to be manually turned on but
    improves gnome integration of gaim.
  * Add avahi-autoipd to laptop task for zeroconf networking that doesn't
    get in the way.
  * Remove the Provides fields, which were always obscure and is better done
    via tests.
  * Add a preseedable tasksel/desktop, which can be used to choose which
    of gnome, kde, or xfce to pick to enhance the desktop task. It's a
    multiselect value, so if you want you can even install more than one,
    or none.

    (which might be on the same partition).

    already pulls in kooka. Closes: #404554
  * Patch from Wen-Yen Chuang to update chinese-t-desktop. Closes: #404567
  * Add xdm to the xfce-desktop task.
  * Since it's more important to have eg, the mousepad editor on the xfce CD
    than OOo, change things around so that the CDs can prioritise the packages
    from foo-desktop tasks over those from the core desktop task. This really
    calls for three levels of importance in packages in tasks, but since there
    are currently only 2, make do by moving fairly essential stuff into the
    Key list for desktop.
  * Add hplip to print server task, this is not needed from a driver POV,
    but it provides hp-setup, which is a very convenient way to set up HP
    printers with CUPS, and also some other utilities for these printers.

  * xserver-xorg has been changed in version 7.1.0-5 to do all hardware
    detection in its postinst, and so the desktop.preinst script to
    pre-install those tools is no longer necessary. Thanks to the X Strike
    Force for finally ending this special case.
  * Hangs during standalone tasksel runs due to apt prompting for a CD
    switch when installing packages in desktop.preinst are therefore no longer
    a problem. Closes: #386244

  * Switch back to x-window-system-core until xorg reaches testing.
  * Rename the "Depends" field to "Enhances" which is much closer to what it's
    actually used for. A task such as french-desktop enchances systems with
    the desktop and french tasks installed on it.
  * Remove the old mozilla-firefox package from the desktop task, firefox is
    the new one & in testing now.
  * Run test scripts for enhancing tasks after task selection, to determine
    whether to install them.
  * kde-desktop task is back. Not installed as part of the desktop task, and
    still hidden from the menu. But:
  * Support preseeding tasks to install using the task name, which is shorter
    and nicer for preseeding than the short description. So for example,
    you can boot with tasksel/first=kde-desktop ..
  * Add kpackage to kde-desktop.
  * Move synaptic to gnome-desktop.
  * Add kdm to kde-desktop. Note that gdm is pulled in via gnome-desktop only.
  * Add a Provides field, this is used to let tasksel know if two alternate
    tasks, such as gnome-desktop and kde-desktop provide the same essential
    thing. If so, tasksel will try to avoid selecting both for install.
  * If an enhancing task is selected (by preseeding), make sure to select
    the tasks it enhances too. The add any other tasks that also enhnce
    those tasks, unless they provide the same thing. In other words, this
    allows preseeding kde-desktop, and getting desktop and any appropriate
    lang-desktop, but not gnome-desktop.

    - Add Bulgarian language and desktop language tasks contributed by
      Anton Zinoviev. Closes: #271178
    - Add tf2pt1, ttf2pt1-chinese and ttfprint to chinese-s an chinese-t to
      support printing of asian fonts. Closes: #305148
    - Remove language-env from chinese-t, since language-env does not support
      Chinese simplified yet. See #301496
    - Add scim-chewing and m17n-env to chinese-t-desktop, remove old cpanel
      and chinput input methods. Closes: #301496
    - Also remove language-env from chinese-s as it doesn't support that
      either, and remove obsolete cpanel from chinese-s-desktop too.
    - Add basic Arabic tasks. Closes: #282493
    - Add printconf to print-server for automatic printer setup. Closes: #293108
    - Add windbind to file-server since it's commonly used with samba.

    - Look for desc files in /usr/local/share/tasksel too. Closes: #286170
    - Replace mozilla with firefox in desktop task. Closes: #282166
    - Add "force" test script contributed by Free Ekanayaka. This allows
      adding Test-force lines to tasks that force them to be installed,
      skipped, marked, or shown, without needing to write any code,
      and may be useful for CDDs. Closes: #275303
    - Allow later task descs to override earlier ones, useful if you
      want to blow away the standard Debian tasks, perhaps by using Test-force
      to hide them. Closes: #274936
    - Add a "new-install" test script (and export NEW_INSTALL for test
      scripts), to allow special control of tasks during new installs.
    - Add a new "standard" task which defaults to being marked for install
      on new installs and is otherwise hidden (because removing it makes
      little sense), and which causes all standard or above priority packages
      to be installed. Closes: #301273, #298702
    - Remove the -r, -i, and -s switches as unnecessary given the standard
      task.
    - Remove the -n switch since it was intended to be used with other removed
      switches.
    - Make the lang test only do anything on new installs, to avoid tasksel
      looking at the LANG variable in everyday use.
    - Rename Packages field in input task files to Packages-list to allow
      really specifying a Packages value.
    - Deal better with ctrl-c cancel while in debconf.

    - Replace gnome-gnomines with gnome-games in games task, package rename.
      Closes: #190874
    - Replace xtris with the currently popular tetrinet in games task.
    - Make "available file" message recommend running dselect update.
      Closes: #153016, #183690
    - Replace netenv (with its nasty boot-time prompt) with guessnet (with
      its slick new ifupdown integration) in laptop task.
    - Add hdparm to laptop task, since many laptop users will want to use it
      to speed up (or turn off!) their disks. Closes: #87450
    - Add menu to office task.
    - Added a java task. Closes: #108061
    - Removed inlined Spanish translation of spanish task. However we should
      add translations, it's not like that!
    - Added a Thai task. Closes: #122663. Needs review since the bug's package
      list was 2 years old.
    - Cleaned up bad wording in most of the descriptions of the
      language-specific tasks.
    - Added sudo to unix-server.
    - Added kernel-compile task for custom kernel building. Closes: #184428
    - Blessed the idea of putting Maintainer fields in individual task files.
    - Removed nonexistant packages from tasks: netscape-zh-resource-477,
      dialdcost, hanterm, tktabble-dev
    - Put cxterm-ks in korean task to replace hanterm. I hope that's right.
    - Rename mozilla-locale-es to mozilla-locale-es-es.
    - For chinese-t, use doc-linux-zh-text, which provides traditional
      chinese. doc-linux-zh-t went away.
    - doincludes.pl and makedesc.pl use apt-cache dumpavail instead of
      dselect available file, for more up-to-date information.
    - Shortended the description of c-dev.
    - Renamed Essential field to Key, to prevent confusion.
    - Implemented dropping of tasks that are missing key packages.
    - Enhanced listpackages.pl with support for listing key packages.
    - makedesc.pl too.
    - Key packages do not need to be listed under Packages too.
    - Updated tcl/tk to 8.4.
    - Removed localces from language tasks; language-env depends on it.
    - Changed around what is Key and what is not, more changes than I can
      record here.
    - Don't expand lsb package's deps, we want the whole thing or nothing.
    - Added makeoverride.pl, which will generate an override file from a
      directory of task files.
    - Remove user-de and user-es, language-env superscedes.
    - Back to just gimp for desktop task.
    - If a task is not in the task desc files, but is in the available file
      as a Task: line, do not display it.

tasksel (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added to games task:
    - vecteroids (asteroids clone)
    - frozen-bubble
  * Rebuilt against current gnome and kde metapackages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Feb 2003 12:29:07 -0500

tasksel (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched from emacs20 to emacs21. Closes: #152018
  * Added Danish language task by Claus Hindsgaul <claus_h@image.dk>.
  * Fixed OOo name. Closes: #158936
  * Patch from Jeff Licquia <licquia@progeny.com> to make tasksel use all
    *.desc files in /usr/share/tasksel, to allow third parties to drop in
     their own additional tasks.
  * This build, at least, will not contain CVS dirs in the source package
    (because I build with DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE=CVS set, and pass -ICVS to
    dpkg-buildpackage. Closes: #148759
  * Added wireless-tools to the laptop task as laptops increasingly use
    wireless cards. I think adding wavemon too is a bit too much.
    Closes: #168948
  * Make the tasksel menu entry work as non-root. Closes: #144340

tasksel (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is aimed at sid, not woody.
  * #include gnome metapackage in desktop task, no need to track gnome
    anymore.
  * Added an "office" task, which will include openoffice when it is in
    debian, and currently includes the stuff in gnome-office. IIRC we three
    talked about such a package for woody, but there did not seem to be enough
    to put in it; there certianly is now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jun 2002 16:59:22 -0400

tasksel (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Essential: fields to all task files. The idea is to skip display of
    a task if all of its essential packages are not available, which will make
    it easier to make CD's that include some package that happens to be in a
    task, without having to drag in that whole task or get the confusing
    situation of having tasksel display the task, but install only one
    ancillary package from it.
  * Changed python task to use python instead of non-existant python-base.
    This task still needs a lot of work.
  * Updated Danish translation da.po by Claus Hindsgaul <claus_h@image.dk>
  * Updated to use debhelper v4 and misc:Depends; removed outdated copyright
    info from debian/rules.

    either have no available file, or don't have kde in the availabe file
    (woody systems).

tasksel (1.17) unstable; urgency=medium

    it manages to somehow it is really in too bad shape to expose newbies to
    it. Closes: #131295
  * (Slipstream release foiled by the NI system. :-)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Feb 2002 13:30:42 -0500

tasksel (1.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added doincludes.pl, and let the desktop task use it to explode the
    kde metapackage, so its entire dep list is put in the task, and if it does
    not ship with woody, we still will get kde. Closes: #135797
  * The same include mechanism should probably be used for the other
    metapackages, like the junior stuff (and X?). But not right now.

    Closes: #116609, #129999
  * Make the basic-desktop task incude all of x-window-system (so it gets a
    WM and xterm and so on), while the desktop task uses just
    x-window-system-core (because it already has a WM and so on from
    gnome and kde). Closes: #129217
  * Removed pydb from python task, because Colin Watson said to.
    Closes: #129520
  * it.po translation added, da.po added (Closes: #122668), ja.po updated,

tasksel (1.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * tasksel changes by Anthony Towns
    - data.c: Made tasksel process fields after the long description. This was
      stopping tasksel for handling the new Packages files that actually
      include Task: headers, so it's kinda useful. :)
    - tasksel.c: When no tasks are present, print a trailing newline.

tasksel (1.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Modifications to existing tasks by Joey Hess
    - added language-env to all language tasks that it supports
    - added netatalk to file-server and print-server
    - renamed modem to dialup, and added stuff for isdn and pppoe to it.
      Also removed a few things like lynx from the task.
    - added aviword to desktop, so there is a basic word processor in there
    - added gimp to desktop too, it's too handy not to be there
    - added lyx to tex
  * New tasks by Joey Hess:
    - web-server -- currently includes only the bare basics, suggestions
      appreciated.
    - unix-server -- a conventional unix server, fully loaded with most of
      the standard unix daemons and userland for console users.
  * Adam Di Carlo:
    - stop shipping upstream ChangeLog
    - number this like a Debian package
    - set urgency to high to cram this into woody for base freeze
    - update our description

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Mon, 28 May 2001 21:03:47 -0400

tasksel (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modifications to existing tasks:
    - Replaced talk of "this [meta]package" with "this task", and like
      changes.
    - In l10n tasks, s/-speaking// for consistency.
    - Make all l10n tasks include locales. It's in base, so this is of
      dubious utility, but some had it and some not.
    - Changed short descriptions of basic-desktop and desktop in an attempt
      to clarify how they're different.
    - Added some comments here and there for unresolved issues.
    - Largely rewrote Debian Jr. descriptions.
    - Added menu to desktop task.
    - Rejiggered mail-server, to be a general purpose mail server, not just
      imap.
    - Moved samba-server to file-server, and made that include nfs stuff
      too.
    - Added a print-server task, that also includes samba, along with other
      stuff.
    - Killed debian-dev(el) task, since it does not meet our task criteria
      -- nowhere near 10% of debian users are debian developers (we hope!),
      and probably not enough regular users will use this package to make
      up the difference. This is my own package, so I'm willing to be
      persuaded otherwise, though..
    - Removed misc window managers from the desktop task. It is unnecessary
      to list them there, since anXious will let the user choose.
    - Killed the demo tasks.
    - Went for consistent capitalization of the short descriptions. Just
      capitalize proper names. I'm not sure if I like this effect, we may
      want to capitalize the first word of each description too.
    - Sundry other changes of little note.
  * Replaced several occurrances of "task packages" with "tasks" elsewhere
    in tasksel.
  * Added -a switch, to show all tasks, even empties. Mostly useful before
    we get tasks into the Packages files, for a global overview of how the
    system will eventually look.
  * Added lint check to makedesc.pl -- it will warn at build time
    about tasks that list unavailable packages. This caught several
    references to virtual packages, etc already, that need to be fixed..
  * VERSION in Makefile automatically tracks this changelog.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2001 22:36:00 -0400

tasksel (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess:
    - Added support for task description files.
    - Read in /usr/share/tasksel/debian-tasks.desc as a task description
      file.
    - Added makedesc.pl, a program to generate a task description file from
      a set of task descriptions.
    - Got rid of all the name prettification code since it is no longer used
      anyway.
    - Killed filterdescription, the task packages in woody actually don't
      have that problem anymore.
    - Don't move cursor to the right after a task is selected.
    - Removed unused tasksel.man from source package (keep pod).
    - Fixed an obscure bug if a task package happened to be the last thing in
      the available file.
    - Enable debug mode by default, but turn it off when building from the
      rules file.

  * Anthony Towns:
    - Fix memory allocation bug when do a fake task- package
    - Port most of the interesting tasks to the tasks file.
    - Fix makedesc.pl to cope with +'s in a task name (c++-dev)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 May 2001 14:47:06 -0400

tasksel (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "Section:" fields to break tasks into different sections. Have a
    hardcoded list of default sections, with a defined order; remaining
    sections get added to the end, in alphabetical order. Sections that
    don't match "tasks-*" are ignored.

  * "tasksel install foo bar baz" as a replacement for "apt-get install
    task-foo task-bar task-baz"

  * Increase the size of the "apt-get install" command line buffer.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Tue, 15 May 2001 15:02:01 +1000

tasksel (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support "Task:" headers to include a package in a task.
    .
    Syntax is:
        Package: foo
        Task: bar, baz, quux
    .
    Note that tasks still require a task-* package in order to have a
    description. Frontends could conceivably treat a task-foo package
    being installed as meaning "automatically install new packages with
    a Task: foo field, but don't worry about old packages that weren't
    installed", similar to dselect's Standard handling, I think.
    .
    Patch thanks to Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>
